# This class definition file enables the Matlab structure-like use of Python 
# objects. 
#
#   Objects of type gb_structure are initialized by 
#       S       = gb_structure 
#
#   Attributes of gb_structure type objects can be set as
#       S.att   = 'Hello world'
#
#   During interactive debugging, fields and values can be looked up by 
#       S.__dict__
